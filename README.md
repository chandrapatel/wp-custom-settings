# WP Custom Settings

Allows developers to create a custom admin menu page with settings using Settings API without registering callbacks to every settings section and field.

Please check [example.php](https://github.com/chandrapatel/wp-custom-settings/blob/master/example.php) file to see how to create custom menu page and settings.

## Supported Input Fields

- Text
- Textarea

*I'll add other input fields support.*

**Note:** I'd suggest to add WP Custom Settings main file in your theme or plugin instead of adding as standalone plugin. This way you can modify it as per your need.
